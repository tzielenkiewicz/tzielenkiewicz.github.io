				My education is an extremely long story...

				<div class="education">
					<div class="smallRectangle">
						MSc
					</div>
					<br/>Once upon a time I wanted to become a chemist. In a chemical factory. That's why I completed my
					MSc at the Faculty of Chemistry, Warsaw University of Technology. The chemistry of explosives
					was my specialty...
				</div>
				
				<div class="education1" id="education1">
					<div class="smallRectangle">
						PhD
					</div>
					<br/>But then I started to like working in a lab as a scientist. And I decided to continue education
					to reach PhD level. The same faculty, the same university, the same topic. All the same
					but much more interesting.
				</div>
				
				<div class="education1" id="education2">
					<div class="smallRectangle">
						DSc
					</div>
					<br/>The "explosive stuff" become too crazy for me, as I started a family. After PhD I continued 
					scientific career at Warsaw University of Life Sciences dealing with wood chemistry. Yes. 
					Wood chemistry. Something like this really exists. Working there I obtained DSc title. 
					You may say, by the way...
				</div>
				
				<div class="education1" id="education3">
					<div class="smallRectangle">
						Coding skills
					</div>
					<br/>Is this part really supposed to be here? I have participated in many online more or less official
					courses and tutorials. EDX from Harvard University, Codecademy, Pluralsight, UIPath Academy 
					and others. Reliable dose of programming knowledge, however without "a paper". Well, I think
					sometimes you may learn better if you do it for yourself, not for a paper.
