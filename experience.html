							<p class="exp-description">
								17 years with calorimeters, spetrometers, chromatographs, flasks, heaters, coolers.
								Dozens of scientific papers, reports, proposals. Time to explosion, steam gun,
								extractives content, wood porosity, XRF mapping, calibration. Many successes and losses. 
								I studied explosives stability, heavy metals content in wood and biomass processing to biofuels.
								Big thing. But no more. This chapter of my life is closed now. The key is hidden. Deeply.

							Lecturer
						</h3>

						<i class="fas fa-university">
							<p class="exp-description">
								In parallel to scientific activity I was an academic teacher. And I was quite good.
								I liked students, I am not sure if mutually. I could start a lecture being not 
								quite sure what to say and finish it after an hour realizing that I want to tell
								them much more, but there is no time left. When I was giving a lecture, I felt like
								an artist on the scene, nomen omen. After some time I rejected stress related to
								conference presentations (most of them were international) and liked that as well.
								I think I miss lecturing the most from "my previous life"...

								Driver

							<i class="fas fa-bus-alt">
								<p class="exp-description">
									When time for a change had come, I decided to try something completely different.
									I became a bus driver. I love that feeling of having such a big mashine under
									complete control. After three months of practice in some "normal" place 
									(Warsaw) I "jumped into the deep water" and went far away to the north. I started 
									to work in arctic Norway. Extremely responsible job, especially in
									specific weather conditions in that part of fjords country. Driving on the ice, 
									in the fog, rain, snow and sun sharply shining during the same day was nothing 
									extraordinary there. I met a few incredible guys. After a year I moved to London.
									Narrow streets and stressed people were my main opponents up there...

							<i class="fas fa-microphone-alt">
								<p class="exp-description">
									Yeeeeez, there was such a period in my life! Ten years on the scene, sometimes
									twice a week. Taverns, festivals, charity concerts and... rock and roll!
									We were playing shanties standards and later ourown songs drifting to
									other types of music (finally we called it 'punk-folk'). I was singing, 
									playing the guitar and harmonica, writing songs... My God, I miss it!

								Developer
							</h3>

							<i class="fas fa-keyboard">
								<p class="exp-description">
									Nowadays I try to begin the developer career. I started quite hobbystic from
									C++ learning and I took fancy so much to coding that I decided that I could do
									it professionally. I learn according to the plan and look for the opportunity
									to start a job. I don't know when I am going to find it but I am very patient.
									And headstrong. Little by little I get familiar with Java, Maven, Git, Rest, 
									Spring, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other languages and tools. I develope a few
									project which may be found on my GitHub (link in the Contact section).
